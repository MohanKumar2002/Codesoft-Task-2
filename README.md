**Tic-Tac-Toe AI
**
Overview:
The Tic-Tac-Toe AI project is an implementation of an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. It employs algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to create an unbeatable AI opponent. This project provides insights into game theory and basic search algorithms.

Features:

AI opponent that employs Minimax or Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
Interactive gameplay against a human player.
Unbeatable AI strategy.
Implementation:

Game Board Representation: Represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board using data structures like arrays or matrices.
Game Logic: Implement game logic to handle player moves, check for win conditions, and determine the game's outcome.
AI Algorithm: Implement the Minimax algorithm to generate optimal moves for the AI player. Optionally, incorporate Alpha-Beta Pruning to enhance efficiency.
User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for players to interact with the game, displaying the game board and accepting player moves.
Game Loop: Implement a loop to alternate between player and AI turns until the game is won, lost, or tied.
Outcome Display: Display the game outcome (win, loss, or draw) at the end of each game.
Usage:

Run the program.
Choose whether to play as 'X' or 'O'.
Make your moves by specifying the cell position.
Watch as the AI opponent makes its moves.
Continue playing until the game ends.
Requirements:

Python 3.x or any preferred programming language.
Basic understanding of data structures and algorithms.
How to Run:

Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
Execute the main program file.
Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the AI.
This project serves as an educational tool to explore game theory concepts and search algorithms while enjoying a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against an unbeatable AI opponent.
